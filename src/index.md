# Introduction

I started to appreciate books (e.g. Audio books) ever since. It helps me to activate my brain, reflect on past experiences and to develop new opportunities. The ratings below are my personal ones, based on how I experienced the book and how relevant it is to my day-to-day life.

* In 2020, I set myself to a goal of reading 1 book a month, **12 a year**.
* In 2021, I was able to listen to **24 books**.
* For 2022, my goal is to listen to **30 books**.
