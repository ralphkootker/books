# Introduction
This page contains an overview of books that I have read and/or are planning to read.

I started to appreciate books (e.g. Audiobooks) since I entered my thirties üòå. It helps me to activate my brain, reflect on past experiences and develop new opportunities. The ratings below are my personal ones, based on how I experienced the book and how relevant it is to my day-to-day life.
