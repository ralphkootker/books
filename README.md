# Introduction
This page contains an overview of books that I have read and/or are planning to read.

I started to appreciate book (e.g. Audiobooks) since I entered my thirties. It helps me to activate my brain, reflect and develop myself as a human being. The ratings below are my personal ratings, based on how I experienced the book and how relevant it is to my day-to-day life.
